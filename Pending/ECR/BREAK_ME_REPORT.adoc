=== 🎉 EASTER EGG: THE STARFORTH CHALLENGE 🎉

....
     ⭐  C O N G R A T U L A T I O N S  ⭐

  You've discovered the hidden StarForth challenge!

  Your system just survived 782 exhaustive tests.
  But can YOU survive the ULTIMATE FORTH CHALLENGE?

  🏆 THE STARFORTH MASTER CHALLENGE 🏆

  Write a Forth program that:
  1. Prints the Fibonacci sequence up to 1000
  2. Uses ONLY the following words:
     : ; DUP OVER DROP SWAP . CR < IF THEN DO LOOP
  3. Fits in exactly 79 characters (FORTH-79 tribute!)

  Submit your solution to the StarForth community!

  Hint: Think recursively, but remember FORTH-79
        doesn't have RECURSE... 😉

  ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

  BONUS SECRET: If you ran --break-me, you're already
  in the top 1% of Forth enthusiasts. Welcome to the
  elite club! Your system just proved it can handle
  anything you throw at it.

  May your stacks be balanced and your words defined,
         -- The StarForth Development Team ⭐
....

==== 🎮 More Easter Eggs to Find:

[arabic]
. Try defining a word called `+STARSHIP+` and see what happens
. Run `+42 ENTROPY@ .+` to see the universe’s favorite number
. Type `+WORDS+` and count how many contain '`STAR`'
. Check what happens when you `+FORGET FORGET+` (just kidding, don’t!)
