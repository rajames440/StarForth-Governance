== CRITICAL PROCEDURES IN FORCE

=== Version Control & Release Authority

**CRITICAL RULE:** Only the Project Manager (PM) can push code to the prod branch.

**Versioning Rules:**
- CAPA closure → PATCH version increment (automatic)
- ECO approval → MINOR version increment (automatic)
- Major version → PM discretion only (manual decision)

**Release Process:**
1. Code review on qual branch (team review)
2. QUAL pipeline validation (all tests passing)
3. PM reviews release readiness
4. **PM pushes to prod branch (ONLY PM CAN DO THIS)**
5. PROD pipeline builds binary and captures artifacts
6. PM verifies checksums
7. PM approves release
8. Release Manager coordinates deployment

=== CAPA Approval Chain

**Procedure:**
1. QUAL pipeline auto-generates CAPA on test failure
2. QA Lead reviews CAPA
3. QA Lead approves or rejects
4. If approved: Governance Lead routes to archive
5. Version number incremented (automatic)
6. Release tagged and deployed

**Approval Authority:**
- QA Lead approval is required (mandatory)
- PM approval on release is required (mandatory)
- No exceptions without ECR process

=== Document Control Workflow

**Procedure:**
1. Documents generated (automated or manual)
2. Captured in in_basket/ directory
3. Git committed with audit trail
4. Governance Lead monitors for documents
5. Documents routed to Reference/ locations
6. Signatures obtained (if required)
7. Archived with complete audit trail

**Mandatory for:**
- All governance documents
- All process changes
- All policy updates
- All formal specifications

---

== IMPLEMENTATION STATUS

=== Immediately Operational ✅
The following are fully operational and mandatory:
- ✅ QUALITY_POLICY.adoc
- ✅ SECURITY_POLICY.adoc
- ✅ ECR/ECO/CAPA/FMEA processes
- ✅ DOCUMENT_CONTROL_USER_GUIDE.adoc (Parts I-VII)
- ✅ DOCUMENT_CONTROL_VALIDATION_PROTOCOL.adoc
- ✅ in_basket/ capture and routing
- ✅ Version numbering procedures
- ✅ Signatory matrix and approval workflows
- ✅ Formal specifications (9 .thy files)

=== Identified Gaps (CAPA Management)
The following gaps have been identified and are tracked through the CAPA system:

[cols="1,1,1"]
|===
| Gap Category | CAPA Issue | Status

| Backup & Disaster Recovery
| CAPA-035
| Pending (16 hours effort)

| Audit Trail Integrity
| CAPA-036
| Pending (16 hours effort)

| Monitoring & Alerting
| CAPA-037
| Pending (12 hours effort)

| Access Control & Security
| CAPA-038
| Pending (12 hours effort)

| 14 Additional Gaps
| CAPA-039 through CAPA-052
| Pending (tracked in gap analysis)

| Version Control of Deliverables
| CAPA-053
| Pending (16 hours effort)
|===

**Important:** The existence of identified gaps does **NOT** waive procedure compliance. All gaps are managed through the same governance framework using the CAPA process.

   - Code review procedures
   - Branch protection rules

2. **QA Lead** must:
   - Review all CAPAs
   - Approve/reject with documented rationale
   - Maintain quality gates
   - Sign governance documents

3. **Project Manager** must:
   - Approve all releases
   - Verify checksums and artifacts
   - Authorize prod branch pushes (exclusive authority)
   - Make major version decisions

4. **Governance Lead** must:
   - Monitor in_basket/ daily
   - Route documents within SLA (24 hours recommended)

   - Maintain Reference/ organization

5. **All AI Agents** (Codex, Claude, GPT-5) must:

1. **Requested** through the ECR process
2. **Justified** with impact analysis
3. **Approved** by appropriate authority (PM/QM/EM)
4. **Tracked** in governance system
5. **Reviewed** in next governance cycle

Non-compliance will be tracked as a quality issue and may result in CAPA process initiation.

=== Audit & Oversight

- **Weekly:** PM reviews compliance
- **Monthly:** QM audits CAPA and approval processes
- **Quarterly:** Full governance system review
- **Annually:** Comprehensive compliance audit

- Gaps are **managed** through the same governance system
- Full operational validation planned (before production release)

=== Next Review
- **Date:** 2025-12-01
