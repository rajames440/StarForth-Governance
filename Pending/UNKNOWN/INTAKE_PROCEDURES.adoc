== Overview

The **in_basket** directory serves as the **gating mechanism** for all materials entering the [VAULT].

**Core Principle:** Everything entering the formal record (Reference, Validation, CAPA, ECR, ECO directories) **MUST** flow through in_basket first.

This ensures:
- Complete audit trail of all governance decisions
- Peer review before formal record status
- Version control of disposition history
- Traceability for compliance verification

== Intake Process Workflow

```
1. SUBMISSION (submitter)
   └─ Place artifact in appropriate in_basket/<Pathway>/ directory
   └─ Create intake summary (title, date, brief description)

2. TRIAGE (governance team - 24-48 hours)
   └─ Verify completeness
   └─ Assign ID if not already assigned
   └─ Route to appropriate reviewer/approver
   └─ Document in intake log

3. REVIEW (subject matter expert - per SLA)
   └─ Technical/compliance evaluation
   └─ Decision: Approve / Conditional / Reject / Revision Needed
   └─ Document findings and rationale

4. DISPOSITION (governance owner - within 2 business days after review)
   └─ Approve: Move to target [VAULT] directory with version metadata
   └─ Conditional: Return to submitter with requirements (stays in in_basket)
   └─ Reject: Archive in in_basket with decision documentation
   └─ Revise: Return to submitter with specific feedback

5. ARCHIVE (governance team - monthly)
   └─ Dispositioned items moved out of in_basket (to target directory)
   └─ Rejected/archived items compressed and dated
   └─ Intake log updated with final disposition
```

== Intake Log Template

Each pathway maintains an `INTAKE_LOG.adoc` file tracking:

[cols="1,2,2,2,2"]
|===
|Date Received|Submission ID|Title|Reviewer|Disposition
|2025-11-02|DEFECT-001|Stack overflow in DUP word|QA Lead|APPROVED → Defects/DEFECT-001.adoc
|2025-11-02|TEST-001|Coverage report Nov 2025|Test Lead|APPROVED → Validation/TIER_II_QUALITY/TEST_RESULTS
|2025-11-01|ECR-001|Optimize dictionary lookup|Arch Review|CONDITIONAL → Revision needed by 2025-11-08

== Gating Rules (Critical)

**RULE 1:** No document moves from in_basket to any [VAULT] directory without:
- Documented review by qualified reviewer
- Explicit disposition decision
- Metadata (date, reviewer, decision rationale)

**RULE 2:** Rejected items stay in in_basket **indefinitely** as audit trail
- Provides historical record of governance decisions
- Prevents "loss" of rejected proposals
- Supports audit queries like "what was rejected in 2025?"

**RULE 3:** in_basket is never "cleaned up" by deleting items
- Items are organized, archived, or moved to permanent locations
- But audit trail of all submissions is preserved in git history

**RULE 4:** Every in_basket submission gets unique ID
- Format: `<PATHWAY>-<SEQUENCE>` (e.g., DEFECT-0042, ECR-0157)
- ID persists even if disposition is rejection
- Enables audit trail queries

---

== Compliance Notes

- All intake activities logged in git (via commits and file history)
- Audit trail complete: submitter → reviewer → disposition → movement
- No items bypass in_basket (enforced by procedure and peer review)
- Monthly intake summaries support governance reporting
- SLAs enforced by project management/process owner
