= CAPA-001: Fix Critical Parsing Bug in REPL

== Problem Statement

The REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) fails when processing multi-line comments with certain Unicode characters. This affects user experience and prevents valid Forth programs from executing.

== Root Cause

The comment parser does not properly handle Unicode sequences in the input stream. Specifically, emoji characters cause the parser to crash with a segmentation fault.

== Corrective Actions

1. Update comment parser to handle Unicode properly
2. Add unit tests for multi-byte character sequences
3. Validate with emoji-heavy test cases

== Required Signatures

This CAPA requires signature from:

== Timeline

- Implementation: 3 days
- Testing: 2 days
- Deployment: 1 day
