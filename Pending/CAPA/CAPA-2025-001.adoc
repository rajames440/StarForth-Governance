= CAPA-2025-001: Test Defect for Pipeline Validation

== Executive Summary

This is a test CAPA document created to validate the Phase 2 Jenkins disposition pipeline. It demonstrates the complete flow of document processing from in_basket through signature collection to vault archival.

== Problem Statement

=== Observed Behavior
The governance system needs comprehensive testing to ensure all pipelines work correctly with real documents.

== Reproduction Steps

1. Place test document in `in_basket/`
2. Trigger `Jenkinsfile` pipeline
3. Verify document routes to `Pending/CAPA/`
4. Check signature block was added
5. Verify GitHub issue created for signers
6. Confirm escalation tracking setup
