= StarForth Quality Policy & Objectives

**Document ID:** QUALITY_POLICY
**Version:** 1.0.0
**Status:** Active
**Last Updated:** October 30, 2025
**Owner:** Robert A. James (PM)

---

== Executive Summary

StarForth is a formal verification-capable FORTH interpreter designed to be the foundation component of StarshipOS. Quality is non-negotiable: we must achieve zero security vulnerabilities in stable releases and maintain a mathematically proven codebase through formal verification.

This document establishes the quality objectives, acceptance criteria, and measurement methods that define "done" for all changes to StarForth.

---

== Quality Vision Statement

**StarForth Quality Commitment:**

___
StarForth shall be a security-hardened, formally-verifiable FORTH-79 compliant interpreter with zero known vulnerabilities in stable releases, mathematically complete formal verification coverage (100% lemmas proven), and measurable performance stability. Every line of code must be testable, traceable, and verifiable through a combination of automated testing, formal proof, and rigorous code review.
___

== Quantified Quality Objectives

All quality objectives are measurable and verified through automated CI/CD pipelines.

=== 1. Test Coverage & Correctness

[cols="1,2,2"]
|===
|Objective |Target |Measurement

|**Test Pass Rate** |≥99% of test suite passes on stable release |GitHub Actions + Jenkins report pass/fail per stage
|**Code Coverage** |≥85% minimum (↓50% = FAIL, 50-65% = BARELY PASS, ≥65% = GOOD) |SonarQube/Clang coverage reports in PR comments
|**Test Count** |≥675 automated test cases covering core functionality |Test suite count in `make test` output
|**Regression Test SLA** |New tests added within 7 days of reported defect |CAPA process tracks test addition date
|===

**Verification Method:** Automated testing via GitHub Actions (devL stage: smoke test, test stage: full suite, qual stage: formal verification)

**Acceptance Criteria for Release:**
- ✅ All 675+ tests pass
- ✅ Code coverage ≥85%
- ✅ Zero new test failures introduced
- ✅ No regressions from previous release

---

=== 2. Formal Verification & Lemma Completeness

[cols="1,2,2"]
|===
|Objective |Target |Measurement

|**Formal Verification** |100% of critical lemmas proven in Isabelle/HOL |Isabelle proof status in qual stage + formal proof documentation
|**Proof Completeness** |All stated lemmas and invariants have complete proofs |Isabelle .thy file audit + proof coverage report
|**Specification Alignment** |Design specification matches formal specification |Design Review checklist includes spec-to-proof alignment check
|**Certification Ready** |Phase 2 formally verifiable according to IEC 62304 § 7.3 |Formal verification documentation auditable for Phase 2
|===

**Verification Method:** Isabelle/HOL formal verification system (qual stage validates all proofs)

**Acceptance Criteria for Release:**
- ✅ 100% of critical lemmas proven
- ✅ No unsolved proof goals in qual build
- ✅ Proof documentation up-to-date
- ✅ New code changes include proof updates where applicable

**Special Note:** Formal verification is NOT optional. Every significant change to core functionality must include updated Isabelle proofs or explicit justification in THEORY_JUSTIFICATION.adoc.

---

=== 3. Security Vulnerabilities

[cols="1,2,2"]
|===
|Objective |Target |Measurement

|**CVE/Security Bugs** |Zero known security vulnerabilities in stable release |Security audit log in CAPA system + CVE tracker
|**Vulnerability Response** |ASAP remediation (see SECURITY_POLICY.adoc) |Incident response email timestamp + 90-day disclosure
|**Code Security Analysis** |No high-severity SAST (static analysis) findings |SonarQube security findings report in PR
|**Memory Safety** |Zero Valgrind errors (no leaks, no corruption) |Valgrind report in devL CI stage
|===

**Verification Method:** Static analysis tools (SonarQube), dynamic analysis (Valgrind), manual security review

**Acceptance Criteria for Release:**
- ✅ Zero high/critical severity security findings
- ✅ Valgrind clean (no memory errors)
- ✅ Security review passed (code review checklist includes security check)
- ✅ No known CVEs in stable release

|**Latency Targets** |REPL response <100ms for typical operations |Benchmark timing logs
|**Memory Usage** |No unbounded growth; stable across 1000+ iterations |Valgrind heap analysis report
|**Startup Time** |Bootable to REPL within target timeframe (TBD) |Boot-to-REPL timing in make test output
|===

**Verification Method:** Automated benchmarking in test stage + manual performance profiling

**Acceptance Criteria for Release:**
- ✅ Performance benchmarks show ≤10% regression
- ✅ No memory leaks detected
- ✅ No latency outliers or performance cliffs

|**Code Style** |Consistent formatting, documented non-obvious logic |Code review checklist + clang-format verification
|**Documentation** |All public functions documented with rationale |Doxygen generation + doc coverage metrics
|===

**Verification Method:** Automated static analysis + manual code review

**Acceptance Criteria for Release:**
- ✅ All FORTH-79 words tested
- ✅ Zero compiler warnings (-Wall -Werror clean)
- ✅ Code formatted consistently
- ✅ Public API documented

---

== Quality Acceptance Gates

Every change must pass these gates before release:

[cols="1,2,3"]
|===
|Gate |Responsibility |Criteria

|**Developer Self-Test** |Developer |`make clean && make all && make test` passes locally
|**PR Automated Checks** |GitHub Actions |devL stage: build + smoke test pass
|**Code Coverage** |GitHub Actions + Developer |≥85% coverage or explicit justification for exemption
|**QA Validation** |QA (you) |Regression test added; FMEA decision made if applicable
|**Security Review** |Code Review (you) |Security checklist passed; Valgrind clean
|**PM Release Decision** |PM (you) |All previous gates passed; release criteria met
|**Formal Verification** |Isabelle/qual stage |100% lemmas proven; no proof gaps
|===

---

---

== Quality Improvement Process

=== Metrics-Based Quality Improvement

When metrics fall below targets:

1. **Investigation** (within 24 hours)
   - Root cause analysis
   - Trend analysis (is this a new problem or recurring?)
   - Impact assessment

2. **Corrective Action** (within 7 days)
   - Create CAPA issue with findings
   - Implement fix
   - Add/update tests
   - Update documentation

3. **Verification** (before next release)
   - Metrics back to target or above
   - Root cause verified fixed
   - QA sign-off on corrective action

4. **Trend Monitoring** (ongoing)
   - Track if issue recurs
   - Update FMEA if pattern emerges
   - Adjust process if systemic

---

== Quality Decision Matrix

Use this matrix to make judgment calls on edge cases:

[cols="1,2,3"]
|===
|Scenario |Decision |Rationale

|New code has 82% coverage (below 85%) |May proceed if:
- Untestable code (e.g., error path in memory allocation)
- Justified in code comment AND documented in CAPA
- QA approves exemption |Coverage is target, not absolute rule; judgment call allowed with justification

|Performance regresses 12% (exceeds 10%) |Must investigate and fix before release:
- Identify change causing regression
- Optimize or revert
- Document trade-off if intentional |Performance SLA is firm; user experience critical

|Test passes locally but fails in CI/CD |Must fix before merge:
- Likely environmental issue
- Debug in CI/CD environment
- Add CI-specific test if needed |CI/CD is source of truth; local-only passing is insufficient

|All tests pass, but 1 lemma unproven |Must NOT release:
- Formal verification incomplete
- Either prove lemma or remove/refactor code
- Exceptional cases documented in THEORY_JUSTIFICATION |Formal verification non-negotiable; 100% lemmas required

|Security finding rated "Low" |Create CAPA but doesn't block release:
- Plan fix in next sprint
- Document in security changelog
- Track closure in CAPA system |Low-severity issues tracked but don't delay release
|===
