== Executive Summary

ISO/IEC 25010 defines 8 product quality characteristics. This document maps each characteristic to StarForth with specific measurement methods and acceptance thresholds. These characteristics define what "done" means for quality.

Every PR must demonstrate acceptable performance across all 8 characteristics (or document exceptions in CAPA).
