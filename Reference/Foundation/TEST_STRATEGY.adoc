= StarForth Test Strategy

**Document ID:** TEST_STRATEGY
**Version:** 1.0.0
**Status:** Active
**Last Updated:** October 30, 2025
**Owner:** Robert A. James (QA/PM)

---

== Executive Summary

StarForth uses a **three-stage verification pyramid** to validate correctness:
1. **DevL Stage** - Build + smoke test (5 minutes)
2. **Test Stage** - Full test suite + benchmarks (20 minutes)
3. **Qual Stage** - Formal verification via Isabelle/HOL (25 minutes)

This document defines test design methodology, coverage targets, risk-based test selection criteria, and FMEA decision thresholds.

---

== Test Vision Statement

**StarForth Testing Commitment:**

___
StarForth shall achieve comprehensive test coverage (≥85%) with rigorous black-box testing, validation of all FORTH-79 standard words, and complete formal verification through Isabelle/HOL. Every test case is documented, traceable to requirements, and provides evidence of correct behavior. Testing is automated, repeatable, and integrated into CI/CD.

```

**Testing Philosophy:** Black-box testing validates external behavior without knowledge of internal implementation.

---

== Test Stage 1: DevL (Build & Smoke Test)

=== Objective

Fast feedback loop: catch obvious failures within 5 minutes of PR merge.

=== Coverage

[cols="1,2,3"]
|===
|Component |Tests |Purpose

|**Compilation** |0 |Verify code compiles with -Wall -Werror
|**Smoke Test** |~50 |Verify basic REPL boot and core operations
|**Link Verification** |0 |Verify no undefined symbols
|**Rapid Feedback** |~5 min total |Fast iteration (developer watches)
|===

=== Acceptance Criteria

- ✅ Code compiles with zero warnings
- ✅ All smoke tests pass
- ✅ REPL boots to interactive prompt
- ✅ Basic arithmetic operations work (e.g., `1 2 +`)

=== Risk

**Low Risk Stage** - Fast feedback only, not comprehensive testing.

---

== Test Stage 2: Test (Full Test Suite)

=== Objective

Comprehensive validation: verify all functionality works correctly against 675+ test cases.

=== Coverage Target

[cols="1,2,3,2"]
|===
|Metric |Target |Status Indicator |Action

|**Code Coverage** |≥85% (minimum) |🟢 ≥85%: GOOD | Merge approved
| | |🟡 65-84%: BARELY PASS | May merge with justification
| | |🔴 <50%: FAIL | Must increase coverage; don't merge
|**Test Count** |≥675 tests |🟢 ≥675: GOOD | Baseline met
| | |🟡 600-674: ADEQUATE | Approaching baseline
| | |🔴 <600: INSUFFICIENT | Need more tests
|**Test Pass Rate** |≥99% passing |🟢 99%+: GOOD | Release candidate
| | |🟡 95-98%: NEEDS WORK | Investigate failures
| | |🔴 <95%: CRITICAL | Block release; debug required
|===

=== Test Design Methodology: Black-Box Testing

**Definition:** Tests validate behavior of FORTH-79 words without knowledge of internal implementation.

**Test Structure (Standard Template):**

```c
void test_WORD_name(void) {
    // Setup (if needed)
    stack_t stack = stack_init();

    // Execute - Call the WORD with inputs
    push(stack, 5);
    push(stack, 3);
    WORD_NAME(stack);  // E.g., PLUS

    // Verify - Check outputs match specification
    int result = pop(stack);
    assert_equal(result, 8, "5 + 3 should equal 8");

    // Cleanup
    stack_cleanup(stack);
}
```

**Why Black-Box?**
- Tests focus on FORTH-79 specification, not implementation details
- Tests remain valid even if internal code refactored
- Tests verify behavior from user perspective
- No dependency on internal data structures

**Coverage Definition:** Code is "covered" if it executes during test run (measured by code coverage tool).

=== Test Categories

All 675+ tests organized by FORTH-79 categories:

[cols="1,2,3"]
|===
|Category |Tests |Examples

|**Stack Manipulation** |50+ |DUP, DROP, SWAP, ROT, OVER
|**Arithmetic** |40+ |+, -, *, /, MOD, ABS, MIN, MAX
|**Comparison** |30+ |=, <>, <, >, <=, >=
|**Logic** |20+ |AND, OR, NOT, XOR
|**Memory** |60+ |@, !, C@, C!, ERASE, FILL
|**Control Flow** |80+ |IF/ELSE/THEN, DO/LOOP, BEGIN/UNTIL
|**String** |40+ |", WORD, EMIT, TYPE
|**I/O** |60+ |KEY, ACCEPT, EMIT, CR
|**System** |75+ |QUIT, ABORT, .S, WORDS
|**Block Storage** |80+ |BLOCK, BUFFER, SAVE-BUFFERS, FLUSH
|**Formal Proof** |200+ |Isabelle-verified operations (qual stage)
|===

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
```

=== Acceptance Criteria for Release

- ✅ ≥99% of tests pass (allow 1-2 failures only if documented)
- ✅ ≥85% code coverage (all major code paths exercised)
- ✅ No new test failures (regression testing)
- ✅ No performance regressions >10%
- ✅ All compiler warnings resolved

---

== Test Stage 3: Qual (Formal Verification)

=== Objective

Rigorous proof: verify critical operations are mathematically correct using Isabelle/HOL.

=== Coverage

[cols="1,2,3"]
|===
|Component |Lemmas |Purpose

|**Stack Operations** |150+ |Prove DUP, DROP, SWAP preserve invariants
|**Arithmetic** |200+ |Prove +, -, *, / meet specification
|**Memory Safety** |250+ |Prove @ and ! never violate bounds
|**Control Flow** |150+ |Prove IF/THEN/ELSE semantics correct
|**Block Storage** |100+ |Prove BLOCK/BUFFER operations safe
|===

=== Acceptance Criteria for Release

- ✅ 100% of critical lemmas proven (no unsolved proof goals)
- ✅ All lemma proofs reviewed and auditable
- ✅ No "sorry" or "admit" in final proof (shortcuts not allowed)
- ✅ Proof aligns with design specification

=== What Cannot Be Tested (Limitations)

- Performance characteristics (timing-dependent, hardware-specific)
- Isabelle/HOL prover correctness (assumed trustworthy)
- Hardware/OS-level isolation (below StarForth layer)

---

== Risk-Based Test Selection

=== FMEA Decision Framework

When to require FMEA analysis:

[cols="1,3,3,2"]
|===
|Risk Category |Indicator |Decision |Action

|**HIGH RISK** |Complex logic, many code paths, memory access, security-sensitive |REQUIRE FMEA |QA must conduct formal FMEA analysis before QA approval
|**MEDIUM RISK** |Moderate complexity, standard algorithms, well-tested patterns |OPTIONAL FMEA |QA decides based on judgment; risk assessment brief
|**LOW RISK** |Simple operations, refactoring, documentation, test additions |NO FMEA |Approve with standard checklist
|===

=== FMEA Risk Scoring (Suggested)

**Complexity Thresholds (Cyclomatic Complexity):**

[cols="1,2,3"]
|===
|Metric |Threshold |Decision

|**Cyclomatic Complexity** |>10 per function |HIGH RISK → Require FMEA
| |5-10 per function |MEDIUM RISK → Optional FMEA
| |<5 per function |LOW RISK → Standard review only
|**Function Size** |>50 lines |Assess complexity; likely HIGH RISK
| |20-50 lines |Assess complexity; likely MEDIUM RISK
| |<20 lines |LOW RISK unless security-sensitive
|**Test Coverage Change** |New code <50% coverage |HIGH RISK → Require FMEA
| |New code 50-75% coverage |MEDIUM RISK → Optional FMEA
| |New code >75% coverage |LOW RISK → Standard review only
|**Security Sensitivity** |Touches memory/input/crypto |HIGH RISK → Require FMEA
| |Touches control flow |MEDIUM RISK → Optional FMEA
| |Everything else |LOW RISK → Standard review only
|===

**Example Calculation:**

```
CAPA #123: Add MYWORD operation

Complexity Assessment:
  - Cyclomatic complexity: 8 (MEDIUM)
  - Function size: 35 lines (MEDIUM)
  - Test coverage: 78% (LOW RISK)
  - Security: Input validation only (MEDIUM)

Verdict: MEDIUM RISK → Optional FMEA
QA Decision: Brief risk assessment only; no formal FMEA required.
Justification: Well-tested pattern, moderate complexity, good coverage.
```

== Code Coverage Interpretation

=== Coverage Levels Explained

**≥85% (GOOD):**
- All major code paths exercised
- Error handling validated
- Edge cases tested
- Safe to release

**65-84% (BARELY PASS):**
- Most code paths covered
- May have gaps in error handling or edge cases
- Justifiable only with documented explanation
- Require explicit QA approval and CAPA note

**50-64% (INADEQUATE):**
- Significant gaps in coverage
- Untested code paths likely
- High risk of latent bugs
- PR must improve coverage before merge

**<50% (FAIL):**
- Majority of code untested
- Unacceptable risk
- PR rejected; developer must add tests

=== What Counts as "Covered"?

**YES - Line executed during test:**
```
if (x > 5) {           ← Covered if branch taken in test
    result = x * 2;    ← Covered if line executed
}
```

**NO - Line NOT executed during test:**
```
else {                 ← Not covered if branch never taken
    result = 0;        ← Not covered if never executed
}
```

=== Acceptable Uncovered Code

Limited exceptions to coverage targets:

[cols="1,2,3"]
|===
|Scenario |Coverage Exception |Justification

|**Error Path** |Can drop to 50% if untestable in normal operation |E.g., out-of-memory error handling (hard to trigger)
|**Hardware Specific** |Can drop if platform-dependent code not on CI/CD platform |E.g., ARM SIMD operations tested separately
|**Dead Code** |Can drop if code provably unreachable |Must be documented and marked `// UNREACHABLE`
|**Deprecated Code** |Can drop during deprecation period |Mark as deprecated; remove in next LTS
|===

**Exception Approval:** All coverage exceptions must be documented in CAPA and approved by QA.
