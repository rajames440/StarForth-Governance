= Governance Export Notes (Physics Phase 1)
:author: StarForth Physics Working Group
:revdate: 2025-10-23

This checklist captures which Phase 1 artefacts must be mirrored into the
`StarForth-Governance` repository.

== Runtime Interfaces

[%header,cols="1,2,3"]
|===
|Artefact |Location (VM repo) |Governance action
|`physics_runtime.h` |`include/physics_runtime.h` |Copy header verbatim; annotate protocol version and magic constants.
|HOLA protocol memo |`docs/src/internal/HOLA_PROTOCOL.adoc` |Mirror as governance RFC; keep version history.
|Physics formal models |`docs/src/internal/formal/Physics_StateMachine.thy`, `Physics_Observation.thy` |Import into governance proofs tree to allow cross-repository review.
|Scheduler plan updates |`docs/src/internal/PHYSICS_SCHEDULING_PLAN.adoc` |Reference from governance scheduling playbook (Phase 1 appendix).
|Signal map updates |`docs/src/internal/PHYSICS_SIGNAL_MAP.adoc` |Link from governance telemetry charter.
|===

== Process Notes

1. Governance repo retains source-of-truth for ABI versions.
Any change to
`HOLA_PROTOCOL.adoc` or the analytics header MUST update
`HOLA_PROTOCOL_VERSION` there before landing.
2. Formal Isabelle theories should be bundled with build instructions (Holmake or isabelle-jedit session) so governance reviewers can replay proofs.
3. Export scripts should verify the analytics heap size and event channel table to keep governance dashboards consistent.
4. Phase 1 governance deliverables live under `governance/physics/phase1/`; this document should accompany the initial export to serve as a checklist.

== Open Items For Governance

- Decide whether the governance repo will ship pre-built analyzer binaries or just the protocol description.
- Clarify signature requirements for future ABI bumps (magic change or command addition).
- Define approval flow for new HOLA opcodes before Phase 2 experiments begin.
