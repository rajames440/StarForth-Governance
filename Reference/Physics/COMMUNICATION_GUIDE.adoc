= StarshipOS Analogy Cheat Sheet
:toc: left
:toclevels: 1

This internal crib sheet turns the “physics-driven” concept into audience-friendly language.
Keep it handy when you need a quick mental model for different stakeholders.

== Elementary School

- *Classroom helper*: The OS watches when the room gets too loud or kids get tired and nudges everyone back on track so the day stays calm.

== Middle School

- *Video game HUD*: Think of health and energy bars.
StarshipOS tracks “heat” and “noise” bars and changes tactics to keep them balanced.

== High School

- *Car dashboard + cruise control*: Sensors report speed, temperature, and fuel.
The OS adjusts throttle and cooling to smooth the ride.

== Trade Professional (HVAC / Facilities)

- *Building controller*: Pressure/temperature gauges report load.
The controller modulates fans and valves to maintain steady airflow.

== University STEM Student

- *Lab feedback loop*: Voltage, current, and heat readings feed a controller that keeps experiments stable.
The OS treats compute metrics the same way.

== Working Engineer / Developer

- *PID around the VM*: Expose state variables (entropy, latency) as signals, enforce invariants via proofs, and let policy modules tune behaviour.

== Researcher / Academic

- *Dynamical system*: State variables map to thermodynamic constructs, semantics are machine-checked, and scheduling/policy operate on measurable, formally constrained signals.

== Talking Points

- Anchor every analogy with the concrete facts: guard proofs, telemetry fields, and runtime invariants.
- Slide effortlessly between analogies depending on who is listening—same concept, different vocabulary.
- Reinforce that “physics-driven” is not fluff: it’s verifiable feedback loops codified in the VM.
