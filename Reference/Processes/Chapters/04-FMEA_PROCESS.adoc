= Chapter 4: Failure Mode & Effects Analysis (FMEA) Process

**Document ID:** 04-FMEA_PROCESS
**Version:** 1.0.0
**Status:** Active
**Last Updated:** October 30, 2025

== Chapter Overview

**FMEA (Failure Mode & Effects Analysis)** is a structured methodology for analyzing potential failures and their impact. FMEA is triggered by:

1. **HIGH RISK CAPA:** Complex defect with systemic potential
2. **HIGH RISK ECO:** New feature with complex algorithms or verified code impact

This chapter defines the FMEA process, risk scoring methodology, and formal sign-off requirements.

== When FMEA is Required

FMEA is REQUIRED when:

[cols="1,2"]
|===
|Trigger |Example

|**Verified Code Change** |Modifying formally-verified FORTH-79 words
|**Systemic Risk** |Bug likely exists in multiple places
|**Complex Algorithm** |>10 cyclomatic complexity, novel logic
|**Memory Corruption** |Buffer overflow, use-after-free
|**Security Vulnerability** |CVE-level issue or input validation bypass
|**Architectural Change** |Major refactoring or redesign
|===

---

== FMEA Methodology

=== Standard FMEA Table

| Component | Failure Mode | Potential Cause | Potential Effect | Severity | Occurrence | Detection | RPN | Recommended Action | Responsible |

**Column Definitions:**

- **Component:** Which part is analyzed?
- **Failure Mode:** How can it fail?
- **Cause:** Why does it fail?
- **Effect:** What happens if it fails?
- **Severity (S):** 1-10 (impact on users)
- **Occurrence (O):** 1-10 (likelihood)
- **Detection (D):** 1-10 (how easily detected?)
- **RPN:** Risk Priority Number = S × O × D
- **Action:** Mitigation strategy
- **Responsible:** Who implements control?

---

== Risk Scoring

=== Severity Scale (1-10)

[cols="1,2"]
|===
|Score |Definition

|1-2 |Minor - User can work around, no data loss
|3-4 |Low - Inconvenience, rare user impact
|5-6 |Medium - Feature degraded, workaround difficult
|7-8 |High - Feature broken, security concern
|9-10 |Critical - Data loss, crash, security breach
|===

=== Occurrence Scale (1-10)

[cols="1,2"]
|===
|Score |Definition

|1 |Remote - Almost never happens
|2-3 |Low - Rare condition
|4-6 |Medium - Occasionally observed
|7-8 |High - Frequent occurrence
|9-10 |Very High - Always occurs under conditions
|===

=== Detection Scale (1-10)

[cols="1,2"]
|===
|Score |Definition

|1-2 |Certain to detect - Clear symptom
|3-4 |Likely to detect - Most cases caught
|5-6 |Possible to detect - Some cases missed
|7-8 |Difficult to detect - Few tests catch it
|9-10 |Almost undetectable - Hidden failure mode

== FMEA Execution Checklist

```
FMEA EXECUTION CHECKLIST
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

FMEA for: CAPA #NNN or ECO-YYYY-###
QA Lead: Robert A. James
Date Started: {Date}
Completion Target: {Date + 5 days}

PREPARATION
☐ Assemble FMEA team (developer + QA + PM if needed)
☐ Define scope (which components analyzed?)
☐ Define top-level function (what should work?)
☐ Identify stakeholders
☐ Schedule FMEA workshop (2-3 hours)

BRAINSTORMING
☐ List all potential failure modes
☐ Identify root causes for each
☐ Assess potential effects
☐ Document current controls
☐ List detection methods

RISK SCORING
☐ Assign Severity (S) 1-10 for each failure mode
☐ Assign Occurrence (O) 1-10
☐ Assign Detection (D) 1-10
☐ Calculate RPN = S × O × D
☐ Identify high RPN items (>100)

CONTROL IDENTIFICATION
☐ For each high-RPN item:
  ☐ Identify control strategy
  ☐ Assign responsible party
  ☐ Set target completion date
  ☐ Define verification method

DOCUMENTATION
☐ Complete FMEA table (all columns)
☐ Document assumptions
☐ Record decisions and rationale
☐ List action items with owners
☐ Schedule follow-up review

SIGN-OFF
☐ QA review complete and approved
☐ PM aware of high-risk items
☐ Controls assigned and scheduled
☐ FMEA document stored (GitHub or wiki)

== Example FMEA: Stack Underflow Fix (CAPA #42)

```
FMEA: CAPA #42 - Stack Underflow in DROP

Component: Stack Operations (FORTH-79)
Failure Mode: DROP on empty stack → segfault
Root Cause: Missing bounds check (stack_ptr < 1)
Effect: Crash, loss of session, potential data corruption
Severity: 9 (Critical crash)
Occurrence: 3 (Rare, requires specific user error)
Detection: 2 (Obvious crash symptom)
RPN: 9 × 3 × 2 = 54 (Moderate risk)

Current Controls:
  - None (bounds check missing)

Recommended Controls:
  1. Add bounds check: if (stack_ptr < 1) return error
  2. Add unit test: test_drop_empty_stack()
  3. Valgrind memory check
  4. Regression test validation

Control Owner: Developer
Target Date: {Date + 2 days}
Verification: Test passes, code review approved, QA sign-off
```

== FMEA Sign-Off

Once FMEA complete and controls implemented:

```
FMEA SIGN-OFF (CAPA #NNN or ECO-YYYY-###)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

FMEA Document: FMEA-2025-###.adoc
Review Date: {Date}
QA Lead: Robert A. James

COMPLIANCE VERIFICATION
☐ All failure modes identified and scored
☐ High-RPN items have mitigation plans
☐ All controls assigned to responsible parties
☐ All target dates established
☐ Follow-up review scheduled (if needed)

RISK ACCEPTANCE
☐ Residual risk acceptable?
  └─ Remaining uncontrolled risks: {List or "None"}
  └─ Risk accepted by: PM (Robert A. James)
☐ No unacceptable risks remain?
☐ Further action required? {Yes/No, if yes list}

APPROVAL FOR IMPLEMENTATION
☐ FMEA analysis complete
☐ Controls in place or scheduled
☐ QA satisfied with risk mitigation
☐ Safe to proceed with implementation/release

QA Sign-Off: Robert A. James
Date: {Date}

Next Review: {If follow-up needed, schedule date}
