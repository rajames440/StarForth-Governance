= Chapter 2: Engineering Change Order (ECO) Process

**Document ID:** 02-ECO_PROCESS
**Version:** 1.0.0
**Status:** Active
**Last Updated:** October 30, 2025
**Owner:** Robert A. James (PM)

== Chapter Overview

An **Engineering Change Order (ECO)** is the formal approval record that converts an approved **ECR** into a backlog item ready for implementation. ECO is where:
- PM approves feature for implementation
- FMEA decision is made (if applicable)
- Feature is assigned to backlog with priority
- Developer begins implementation work

**Key Distinction:**
- **ECR** = "Should we do this?" (PM evaluation)
- **ECO** = "Yes, we're doing this. Here are the constraints." (PM approval + conditions)

== ECO Creation (PM Action)

When PM approves an ECR, immediately create a new GitHub issue:

=== ECO Issue Template

```markdown
## ECO-YYYY-###: {Feature Name} - Engineering Change Order

### 1. Related ECR
Closes: ECR-YYYY-###

### 2. What Will Be Implemented
Copy/refine the acceptance criteria from ECR:
- [ ] Acceptance criterion 1
- [ ] Acceptance criterion 2
- [ ] Acceptance criterion 3

### 3. Implementation Constraints
Any specific requirements or constraints:
- Must maintain ≥85% test coverage
- Must include formal Isabelle proof (if applicable)
- No breaking changes to FORTH-79 core words
- Must pass security review

### 4. FMEA Decision
Risk assessment (PM determined):
- [ ] LOW RISK - No FMEA required
- [ ] MEDIUM RISK - Optional FMEA (brief risk assessment)
- [ ] HIGH RISK - FMEA REQUIRED (formal analysis by QA)

### 5. Backlog Priority
- [ ] Critical (blocks release)
- [ ] High (next sprint)
- [ ] Medium (within quarter)
- [ ] Low (future consideration)

### 6. Effort Estimate (Refined)
Developer will refine this estimate:
- Small (< 1 day)
- Medium (1-3 days)
- Large (> 3 days)

### 7. Success Criteria
Feature is "done" when:
- All acceptance criteria met
- ≥85% code coverage maintained
- All tests pass (devL → test → qual)
- 100% Isabelle proofs (if applicable)
- Security review passed
- Documentation updated

### 8. Follow-Up Process
- Implementation: Developer creates PR (references ECO-YYYY-###)
- Testing: GitHub Actions validates (devL → test → qual)
- Release: PM approves when ready; merged to master
- Closure: ECO closed when released to users
```

=== ECO Naming Convention

**GitHub Issue:** ECO-YYYY-### (PM assigns, sequential numbering)

Example: `ECO-2025-001: Implement MYWORD Arithmetic Operation`

---

== FMEA Decision Matrix

When creating ECO, PM uses this matrix to decide if FMEA is required:

[cols="1,2,3,2"]
|===
|Risk Level |Examples |Decision |Process

|**LOW RISK** |Documentation, test additions, simple refactoring |NO FMEA |Add to backlog; proceed with implementation
|**MEDIUM RISK** |Standard algorithm, feature in safe area, medium complexity |OPTIONAL FMEA |Brief risk assessment; proceed if acceptable
|**HIGH RISK** |Memory ops, security-sensitive, complex algorithm, verified code changes |REQUIRED FMEA |QA must conduct formal FMEA before implementation
|===

=== Risk Scoring Guidance

**Triggers for MEDIUM/HIGH RISK:**

[cols="1,3,2"]
|===
|Factor |Description |Risk Level

|Cyclomatic Complexity |>10 per function (complex logic) |MEDIUM → HIGH
|Memory Operations |Touches @, !, ERASE (memory access) |MEDIUM → HIGH
|Security Sensitivity |Input validation, state manipulation |MEDIUM → HIGH
|Verified Code Change |Modifies formally-verified FORTH-79 word |MEDIUM → HIGH
|Backward Compatibility |Changes existing behavior |MEDIUM
|Performance Impact |New algorithm or data structure |LOW → MEDIUM
|Test Coverage |New code <50% coverage initially |MEDIUM
|===

=== FMEA Decision Example

**ECO: Add MYWORD Arithmetic Operation**

```
FMEA Risk Assessment:
  - Cyclomatic complexity: 6 (moderate)
  - Memory access: None (pure stack operation)
  - Security: Input range validation needed (medium)
  - Verified code: Yes, affects arithmetic lemmas (high)
  - Backward compat: No change (low)
  - Performance: <5% impact (low)

Verdict: MEDIUM RISK
- Touches verified code (stack semantics)
- Standard arithmetic algorithm (not novel)
- Well-defined acceptance criteria
- Previous similar words validated

Decision: Optional FMEA (brief risk assessment sufficient)
QA Action: Document risk assessment in CAPA or ECO comments
```

== Backlog Entry & Priority Management

Once ECO is approved, add to backlog using this structure:

=== Backlog Priority Levels

[cols="1,2,3,2"]
|===
|Priority |Definition |Action |Timeline

|**CRITICAL** |Blocks release, security fix, P0 bug |Implement immediately |Next sprint
|**HIGH** |Next planned feature, user demand |Schedule for sprint |1-2 sprints
|**MEDIUM** |Planned feature, enhancement |Schedule for quarter |2-4 sprints
|**LOW** |Future enhancement, nice-to-have |Consider for next cycle |TBD
|===

=== Backlog Management Process

1. **Backlog View** (in GitHub Projects/Kanban)
   ```
   Column: "Backlog (Ready for Dev)"
   │
   ├─ ECO-2025-001: MYWORD arithmetic (HIGH)
   ├─ ECO-2025-002: Block storage optimization (MEDIUM)
   ├─ ECO-2025-003: Documentation update (LOW)
   │
   Ordering: CRITICAL → HIGH → MEDIUM → LOW
   ```

2. **Sprint Selection** (Next sprint planning)
   - PM selects next ECO from Backlog
   - Assign to developer
   - Move to "In Progress" column
   - Developer begins implementation

3. **Implementation** (Developer work)
   - Create feature branch: `feature/eco-2025-001`
   - Implement per acceptance criteria
   - Add tests (maintain ≥85% coverage)
   - Add formal proofs (if verified code)
   - Create PR linked to ECO

4. **Release** (After all stages pass)
   - PM approves release (1-day SLA)
   - Tag version in git
   - Update release notes
   - Close ECO issue

---

== ECO → Development Workflow

When developer starts work on ECO:

```
ECO-2025-001 (In Backlog)
    ↓ (PM assigns to developer)
Developer: git checkout -b feature/eco-2025-001
    ↓
Implement feature per acceptance criteria
    ↓
Add/update tests (maintain ≥85% coverage)
    ↓
Add/update Isabelle proofs (if applicable)
    ↓
Developer: git push origin feature/eco-2025-001
    ↓
Create PR on GitHub:
  - Title: "ECO-2025-001: Implement MYWORD arithmetic"
  - Description: Links to ECO issue (Closes ECO-2025-001)
  - References acceptance criteria from ECO
    ↓
GitHub Actions runs:
  - devL stage: Build + smoke test
  - test stage: Full test suite + coverage
  - qual stage: Formal verification
    ↓
All stages PASS?
  ├─ YES: PR ready for QA/PM review
  └─ NO: Developer fixes and re-tests
    ↓
QA reviews PR (FMEA if required in ECO)
    ↓
PM approves release (1-day SLA)
    ↓
PR merged to master (prod pipeline runs)
    ↓
Feature released to users
    ↓
ECO-2025-001 marked CLOSED
```

See **Chapter 3: CAPA_PROCESS.adoc** for defect handling during implementation.

---

== High-Risk FMEA Workflow

If ECO is marked HIGH RISK, FMEA is required:

```
ECO-2025-001: MARKED HIGH RISK
    ↓
PM notifies QA: "FMEA required"
    ↓
QA creates FMEA issue (FMEA-2025-001)
  - Links to ECO-2025-001
  - Documents failure modes
  - Identifies controls/mitigations
    ↓
[See Chapter 4: FMEA_PROCESS.adoc]
    ↓
FMEA completed and signed off
    ↓
Implementation proceeds (developer can now start)
    ↓
Development, testing, release
```

---

== ECO Closure

ECO is closed when:

1. **Feature Released** (Primary closure)
   - PR merged to master
   - Version tagged
   - Users can access feature
   - **Action:** PM closes ECO issue with comment:
     ```
     ✅ RELEASED in v2.0.2

     Feature implemented, tested, and released to users.
     See https://github.com/rajames440/StarForth/releases/tag/v2.0.2
     ```

2. **Deferred/Cancelled** (Secondary closure)
   - If feature is deferred to future release
   - If feature is cancelled
   - **Action:** PM closes ECO with comment:
     ```
     ❌ DEFERRED to Phase 2

     Reason: Depends on seL4 port (Phase 2 requirement).
     Will re-open ECO-YYYY-### when Phase 2 begins.
     ```

---

== Compliance References

This ECO process aligns with:

- **ISO 9001:2015** § 8.3 (Control of externally provided processes)
- **ISO/IEC 12207:2017** § 6.3 (Development process)
- **IEC 62304:2015** § 7.1 (Software development planning)
