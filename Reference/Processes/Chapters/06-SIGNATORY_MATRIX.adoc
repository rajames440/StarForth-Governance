---

### CAPA Approval (QA → PM Chain)

```
CAPA #456 Submitted
  ↓ (QA review)
☐ Approve → Proceed to FMEA decision
☐ Reject → Return to developer
  ↓
FMEA Decision (QA determines need)
  ↓
☐ No FMEA → Proceed to PM
☐ Optional FMEA → Brief assessment, proceed to PM
☐ Required FMEA → Conduct FMEA, then to PM
  ↓
PM Release Decision (1-day max)
  ↓
☐ Approve → Release
☐ Hold → Specify blocker
☐ Defer → Defer to next release
  ↓
CAPA CLOSED (with version tag)
```

**Signatories:** QA approves → PM approves (PM final authority)

---

### FMEA Sign-Off (QA Role)

```
FMEA-2025-001 Analysis
  ↓ (QA conducts analysis)
Complete failure mode table
Assign severity/occurrence/detection scores
Identify risk controls
  ↓ (QA review)
Risk acceptable?
  ├─ YES → QA sign-off
  └─ NO → Identify additional controls
  ↓
PM Risk Acceptance (If required)
  ↓
FMEA CLOSED
```

**Signatories:** QA (analysis & technical sign-off); PM (risk acceptance if needed)

---

### Release Approval (PM Role, 1-Day SLA)

```
PR Ready (All tests pass, QA approved, FMEA complete if required)
  ↓ (PM review, 1-day max)
☐ Approve → Merge to master, tag v2.0.2
☐ Hold → Specify blocker
☐ Defer → Defer to next release
  ↓
VERSION TAGGED & RELEASED
```

**Signatory:** PM (Robert A. James)

== Sign-Off Documentation

### Electronic Signature (Future)

When multi-person team exists, use GitHub:
- PR "Approve" button = signature
- "Approved" label = formal sign-off
- Comments with approval timestamp

---

## Escalation Path

Current (single person team):
```
All approval decisions → PM (You)
         ↓
    (You decide)
         ↓
    Execute decision
```

Future (multi-person team):
```
Developer question → QA/PM
         ↓
QA question → PM
         ↓
PM decision → Cannot escalate (final authority)
```

---

== Compliance References

This signatory matrix aligns with:

- **21 CFR Part 11** (Authenticated electronic signatures)
