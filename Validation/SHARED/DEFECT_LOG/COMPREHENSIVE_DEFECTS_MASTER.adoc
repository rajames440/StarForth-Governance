- **Severity Breakdown:** 10 MAJOR, 20 MINOR (0 CRITICAL)
- **Category Breakdown:** 14 Documentation gaps, 8 Operational gaps, 3 Code defects, 3 Monitoring gaps, 2 Security gaps
- **Critical Blockers:** Disaster recovery, rollback procedures, incident response, formal verification completion
- **Compliance Impact:** Multiple ISO 9001/27001 gaps require Phase 2 remediation

---

== MAJOR DEFICIENCIES (10) - REQUIRE IMMEDIATE ATTENTION

=== CAPA-004: Limited Error Context in File Operations

**Location:** `src/word_source/starforth_words.c:239`, `src/word_source/system_words.c:111`, `src/main.c:343`

**Type:** Error Handling
**Severity:** MAJOR

**Problem:** File operations (fopen, fread, fwrite, fclose) fail silently without reporting OS-specific error messages (errno/strerror context). When files can't be opened or read, users get generic errors without knowing root cause (permission denied, disk full, file not found, etc.).

**Impact:**
- Difficult debugging in production when file operations fail
- Critical for disk image loading and init.4th initialization
- Users cannot determine if issue is permission, hardware, or configuration
- Affects user experience and troubleshooting

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. All file operations report strerror() context to diagnostics
2. Error messages include errno value and human-readable explanation
3. File operation failures logged with full context
4. Integration tests validate error reporting for various failure modes

**Timeline:** Sprint 1-2 (10-20 story points)

---

=== CAPA-005: Memory Corruption in TOP-WORDS Sorting

**Location:** `src/word_source/starforth_words.c:158-176`

**Type:** Code Defect / Security
**Severity:** MAJOR

**Problem:** Fixed-size array `words_with_entropy[1000]` used without bounds checking. If dictionary grows beyond 1000 words with entropy tracking enabled, loop silently exceeds array bounds and corrupts stack memory. No overflow detection or warning.

**Impact:**
- **Security:** Memory corruption vulnerability could lead to stack smashing
- **Stability:** VM crash with large dictionaries
- **Potential:** Arbitrary code execution (mitigated by STRICT_PTR mode but still exploitable)
- **Regression Risk:** Breaking change if increased later

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Replace fixed array with dynamic allocation (vector/malloc)
2. Add bounds checking before array access
3. Add assertion/validation of array size
4. Unit tests with >1000 words in dictionary
5. Stress test with maximum-size dictionary

**Timeline:** Sprint 1 (15-20 story points)
**Theory Required:** YES (memory safety critical)

---

=== CAPA-006: Missing Disaster Recovery Plan

**Location:** Project-wide (missing documentation)

**Type:** Operational / Compliance
**Severity:** MAJOR

**Problem:** No documented disaster recovery procedures, RTO/RPO targets, backup strategy for disk images, state recovery procedures, or data loss prevention mechanisms.

**Impact:**
- **Compliance:** IEC 62304, ISO 27001 require disaster recovery planning
- **Operations:** Cannot recover from data corruption or system failure
- **Availability:** Extended outages possible without recovery procedures
- **Risk:** Unplanned data loss possible

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Define RTO (Recovery Time Objective) and RPO (Recovery Point Objective) targets
2. Document backup strategy for disk images and configuration
3. Create state recovery procedures
4. Document data loss prevention mechanisms
5. Create disaster recovery runbook

**Timeline:** Sprint 2-3 (20-30 story points)

**Type:** Operational / Workflow
**Severity:** MAJOR

**Problem:** No documented rollback procedures for failed releases. Unclear what happens if: prod → master merge fails, qual → test revert needed, or production incident requires rollback. No disaster recovery playbook.

**Impact:**
- **Incidents:** Production incident response unclear, could extend outages
- **Compliance:** ISO 27001 requires documented change control and rollback
- **Risk:** Extended downtime possible during failures
- **Safety:** Unclear rollback path for medical device certification

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Document rollback triggers and decision matrix
2. Create rollback procedures for each stage (dev → test → qual → prod)
3. Document version rollback strategy
4. Create rollback testing procedures
5. Document communication plan during rollbacks

**Timeline:** Sprint 2 (15-20 story points)

**Severity:** MAJOR

**Problem:** Multiple functions marked TODO_PROOF. Refinement proofs between Isabelle specifications and C implementation incomplete. Using Isabelle `sorry` (placeholder proofs) instead of complete formal verification. Blocks certification for medical device compliance (IEC 62304).

**Impact:**
- **Certification:** Cannot certify system for regulated industries (medical device)
- **Compliance:** IEC 62304 § 7.3 requires formal verification
- **Correctness:** Formal correctness claims unsupported
- **Phase 2:** Blocks StarshipOS certification path

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Complete all TODO_PROOF refinement proofs
2. Eliminate all `sorry` statements in critical lemmas
3. `make qual` passes with 100% proof coverage for verification target
4. REFINEMENT_ANNOTATIONS.adoc updated with completion status
