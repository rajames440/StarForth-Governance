== Signature File Format

Signatures are stored as detached PGP files adjacent to documents:

```
Pending/CAPA/CAPA-001.adoc
Pending/CAPA/CAPA-001.rajames440.asc       ← PGP signature from rajames440
Pending/CAPA/CAPA-001.qa-lead.asc          ← PGP signature from qa-lead
```

Each `.asc` file is a detached GPG signature. Verification:

```bash
gpg --verify CAPA-001.rajames440.asc CAPA-001.adoc
```

== Signature Status in Documents

Documents contain an AsciiDoc signature table showing collection progress:

== Adding New Signers

To add a new authorized signer:

1. Obtain their full name, email, and GPG public key fingerprint
2. Update this document (Signatures.adoc)
3. Add to appropriate Authority Level group
4. Create pull request with change
5. Requires PM (rajames440) approval

== Revoking Signers

To revoke signer authority:

1. Mark signer as `Inactive` in this document
2. Document reason for revocation
3. Any documents awaiting that signer's signature are escalated to PM
4. Create pull request with change

== Signature Validation Process

When a signature file is detected:

1. **File Presence:** Verify `.asc` file exists
2. **Filename Format:** Validate `[doc-name].[signer-username].asc`
3. **Signer Authorization:** Check signer in Authorized Signers list
4. **Signature Validity:** Verify GPG signature matches document content
5. **Status Update:** Update signature table with timestamp
6. **Create PR:** Create signature collection PR (PR #2 or #3)
7. **Merge:** Merge to master once verified

== Document Controlled Status

**Controlled Documents** (require signature + vault storage):
- CAPA, ECR, ECO, FMEA, DHR, DMR, CER, DWG, ENG, SEC, IR, VAL, DTA

**Uncontrolled Documents** (no signature required, no vault storage):
- ART (Articles/References)
- MIN (Minutes)
- REL (Release Notes)
- RMP (Risk Management Plans)

Uncontrolled documents remain in Pending/ as permanent reference material.
