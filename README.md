# StarForth Governance Repository

**Component Validation Blueprint for FORTH-79 Standard Compliance**

- **License:** CC0 v1.0 (public domain)  
- **Repository:** https://github.com/rajames440/StarForth  

## Purpose

This governance repository establishes:

1. **Standards Compliance** - Proof that StarForth meets FORTH-79 specification  
2. **Code Quality** - ANSI C99 strict compilation, no compromises  
3. **Portability** - StarForth runs unchanged across multiple hypervisors  
4. **Testing** - 675+ test suite validates all functionality  
5. **Architecture** - Design decisions and rationale documented

## How StarForth Fits StarshipOS

StarForth is the **portable application/OS layer** that can run on:

1. **Phase 1 (NOW):** L4Re/Fiasco.OC (proven microkernel foundation)  
2. **Phase 2 (COMING):** seL4 (formally verified microkernel)  
3. **Phase 3 (FUTURE):** Hardware directly (StarForth as kernel)  

This governance repo proves **StarForth’s component-level correctness** independent of hypervisor.  
The StarshipOS governance repo handles **architecture and hypervisor integration** per phase.

## Key Defensibility Claims

✅ **StarForth is FORTH-79 standard compliant**  
- Evidence: 675+ test suite with standard mapping  
- Audit trail: Git history and test coverage  

✅ **StarForth is strict ANSI C99**  
- Evidence: Builds with `-std=c99 -Wall -Wextra -Werror`  
- Validation: All platforms, all compilers  

✅ **StarForth is portable across hypervisors**  
- Evidence: Runs on Linux, L4Re, seL4, embedded  
- Architecture: Platform abstraction layer  

✅ **StarForth has zero external dependencies**  
- Evidence: Standalone static binary  
- Proof: No malloc, printf, or libc required  

🧩 **Formal Verification in Progress – Isabelle/HOL Integration**  
- The **StarForth VM semantics and dictionary model** are currently being encoded in **Isabelle/HOL**, targeting formal proof of core execution correctness.  
- This effort will yield **machine-checked proofs** ensuring that stack transitions, word execution order, and control structures adhere precisely to FORTH-79 semantics.  
- Once complete, this proof framework will extend to **Phase 2 (seL4)** for **formally verified microkernel + formally verified VM** co-validation — a first in the FORTH ecosystem.  

## Standards Validation Strategy

StarForth can be validated across **5 stringency layers** from basic software engineering to formal proof-based assurance:

**Layer 1: Foundation** – Professional software engineering (ISO/IEC 12207, 25010, 29119)  
**Layer 2: Reliability/Quality** – Secure coding and automated quality (ISO 5055, CERT C, NIST SSDF)  
**Layer 3: Safety** – Functional safety standards (IEC 61508, ISO 26262, DO-178C)  
**Layer 4: Security** – Security evaluation and certification (Common Criteria, ISO 27034)  
**Layer 5: Formal Assurance** – **Mathematical proof (Isabelle/HOL) + verified platform (seL4)**  

> ✳️ **Isabelle/HOL proofs are currently being developed** for the StarForth VM core, focusing on stack discipline, return handling, and word immutability.  
> This will enable **Layer 5** compliance (formal assurance) under ISO/IEC 15408 and IEC 61508 frameworks.

## Formal Verification Roadmap (In Progress)

| Phase | Scope | Description | Deliverables | Status |
|-------|--------|--------------|---------------|---------|
| **1. Semantic Model Encoding** | VM Core | Encode StarForth stack & word semantics in Isabelle/HOL | `StarForth_Semantics.thy` | 🟢 In Progress |
| **2. Invariant Proofs** | Control & Stack Safety | Prove stack consistency, return integrity, and deterministic execution | Proof bundle & lemmas | 🟢 In Progress |
| **3. Behavioral Equivalence** | VM vs Reference | Prove equivalence between StarForth implementation and formal model | Isabelle equivalence theorems | 🟡 Planned |
| **4. Integration with seL4** | Phase 2 Validation | Extend proof framework to include seL4 runtime and process model | Combined proof stack | ⚪ Future |
| **5. Publication & Certification** | Formal Validation | Publicly release proofs and integrate with ISO 15408 evaluation | Published HOL archive + audit doc | ⚪ Planned |

## For Siemens/Polarion

This repository demonstrates that **StarForth is a proven, defensible component** that can be used in increasingly verified hypervisor environments (L4Re → seL4 → none).

When evaluating StarshipOS for ALM support, note:

- **StarForth validation:** Complete today (standards compliance + testing)  
- **StarForth portability:** Platform-independent layer proven  
- **StarshipOS Phase 1:** Valid today (proven component + proven hypervisor)  
- **StarshipOS Phase 2:** Requires ALM (adds novel physics algorithms to proven stack)  
- **StarForth formal verification:** Isabelle/HOL model in progress
