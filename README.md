## How StarForth Fits StarshipOS

StarForth is the **portable application/OS layer** that can run on:

1. **Phase 1 (NOW):** L4Re/Fiasco.OC (proven microkernel foundation)  
2. **Phase 2 (COMING):** seL4 (formally verified microkernel)  
3. **Phase 3 (FUTURE):** Hardware directly (StarForth as kernel)  

This governance repo proves **StarForth’s component-level correctness** independent of hypervisor.  
The StarshipOS governance repo handles **architecture and hypervisor integration** per phase.

## Key Defensibility Claims

✅ **StarForth is FORTH-79 standard compliant**  
✅ **StarForth is strict ANSI C99**  
✅ **StarForth is portable across hypervisors**  
✅ **StarForth has zero external dependencies**  

🧩 **Formal Verification in Progress – Isabelle/HOL Integration**  
- The **StarForth VM semantics and dictionary model** are currently being encoded in **Isabelle/HOL**, targeting formal proof of core execution correctness.  
- This effort will yield **machine-checked proofs** ensuring that stack transitions, word execution order, and control structures adhere precisely to FORTH-79 semantics.  
- Once complete, this proof framework will extend to **Phase 2 (seL4)** for **formally verified microkernel + formally verified VM** co-validation — a first in the FORTH ecosystem.  

## Standards Validation Strategy

StarForth can be validated across **5 stringency layers** from basic software engineering to formal proof-based assurance:

**Layer 1: Foundation** – Professional software engineering (ISO/IEC 12207, 25010, 29119)  
**Layer 2: Reliability/Quality** – Secure coding and automated quality (ISO 5055, CERT C, NIST SSDF)  
**Layer 3: Safety** – Functional safety standards (IEC 61508, ISO 26262, DO-178C)  
**Layer 4: Security** – Security evaluation and certification (Common Criteria, ISO 27034)  
**Layer 5: Formal Assurance** – **Mathematical proof (Isabelle/HOL) + verified platform (seL4)**  

> ✳️ **Isabelle/HOL proofs are currently being developed** for the StarForth VM core, focusing on stack discipline, return handling, and word immutability.  
> This will enable **Layer 5** compliance (formal assurance) under ISO/IEC 15408 and IEC 61508 frameworks.

### Verification Independence Statement

A legitimate concern in any formal assurance effort is **avoiding self-verification** — ensuring we did not simply formalize StarForth's implementation so that proofs trivially hold.  
StarForth’s Isabelle/HOL effort follows **independent model derivation** and **bidirectional validation** principles:

1. **Specification First, Code Second**  
   The Isabelle/HOL model (`StarForth_Semantics.thy`) is derived **solely from the FORTH-79 specification**, not from the StarForth source code.  
   The model defines what *should* happen — the C99 implementation is later validated *against* it.

2. **Bidirectional Validation**  
   - From theory → code (ensuring C99 conforms to the formal model).  
   - From code → theory (ensuring the model faithfully represents all valid behaviors).

3. **Reviewer Independence**  
   Formalization and proof review are intentionally separated.  
   Third-party reviewers and academic collaborators will audit the proofs and methodology.

4. **Model Transparency**  
   All Isabelle/HOL sources, lemmas, and proofs are published openly, ensuring reproducibility and community validation.

5. **Traceability to Specification**  
   Each theorem links to a specific FORTH-79 clause, preserving end-to-end traceability from **spec → model → code → test**.

> ⚖️ **StarForth’s proofs validate FORTH-79 semantics — not StarForth’s implementation choices.**  
> The implementation earns its validity by conforming to an independently derived mathematical model.

### Openness to Scrutiny and Collaboration

StarForth’s formal verification effort welcomes **open, thoughtful participation** from the wider research and formal methods community.  
We recognize that true assurance requires **transparency, reproducibility, and peer engagement** — not isolation.

- All Isabelle/HOL proofs and models will be **publicly accessible**.  
- Constructive criticism, proof reviews, and academic replication efforts are **explicitly encouraged**.  
- We invite **formal methods practitioners, language theorists, and systems engineers** to review, challenge, and refine our approach.  
- Feedback loops are logged and attributed, ensuring that collaborative improvements are traceable within the governance record.  

> 🧠 *We don’t hide from scrutiny — we design for it.*

## For Siemens/Polarion

This repository demonstrates that **StarForth is a proven, defensible component** that can be used in increasingly verified hypervisor environments (L4Re → seL4 → none).

When evaluating StarshipOS for ALM support, note:

- **StarForth validation:** Complete today (standards compliance + testing)  
- **StarForth portability:** Platform-independent layer proven  
- **StarshipOS Phase 1:** Valid today (proven component + proven hypervisor)  
- **StarshipOS Phase 2:** Requires ALM (adds novel physics algorithms to proven stack)  
- **StarForth formal verification:** Isabelle/HOL model in progress and open to audit
