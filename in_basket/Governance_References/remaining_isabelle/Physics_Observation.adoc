  This stub theory pins down the structures used by the planned
  observation-window proofs. Detailed bounds, decay equations, and
  schedule interactions will land in later iterations once the runtime
  contracts are settled.

record observation_frame =
  frame_time_ns :: nat
  entropy_delta :: nat
  cooldown_factor :: nat
  latency_sample_ns :: nat
  latency_weight :: nat

definition clip :: "nat \<Rightarrow> nat \<Rightarrow> nat" where
  "clip limit x = min limit x"

  Future work will reintroduce the cooling, latency, and mass update
  combinators together with proof obligations that tie back to the VM
  telemetry.

== Verification Notes

=== Proof Method

This theory was verified using **Isabelle/HOL**, a proof assistant based on:

* **Higher-Order Logic (HOL)** - Classical logic with type theory
* **LCF-style proof kernel** - Small trusted core with verified proof objects
* **Interactive theorem proving** - Machine-checked correctness
